# BeyondTech Installment Financing Strategy – BCG Forage Project  
An end-to-end consulting project analyzing market demand, financial impact, consumer sentiment, and strategic fit for BeyondTech’s proposed installment financing model.

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains my complete work for the BCG Strategy Consulting Virtual Experience Program, where I evaluated whether BeyondTech, a global telecom and technology company, should adopt an installment financing model for its devices.

BeyondTech currently faces:
- Declining customer retention  
- Slower-than-expected sales  
- Rising consumer sensitivity to upfront device costs  
- Competitive pressure from rivals offering financing  

This project determines whether installment financing is a strategically and financially viable option, supported by analysis of competitors, consumers, and internal capabilities.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. Is installment financing a viable option for BeyondTech?  
2. How has financing impacted competitor financial performance?  
3. What do consumers think about payment plans?  
4. What risks exist and how can they be mitigated?  
5. What should the implementation timeline look like?

## Market Research and Consumer Insights

- Evaluated willingness to adopt financing, interest rate sensitivity, loan duration preferences, and demographic differences  

### Key Findings:

## Competitor Financial Analysis

Analyzed financial statements for three competitor companies:

| Company | Financing Model |
|--------|------------------|
| X | No financing |
| Y | 12-month, 0% financing |
| Z | 12–24 month financing, 2% interest |

Key comparisons included:
- Revenue growth  
- Operating expenses  
- Interest income and interest expense  
- Accounts receivable and debt levels  
- Cash flow trends  
- Profitability impact over time  

### Insights:
- Companies with financing have consistently stronger sales growth  
- Profit dips short term due to delayed cash inflow and higher debt  
- Profit recovers long term as portfolios stabilize  
- Interest-bearing financing (Company Z) generates additional revenue

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Key Risks:
1. Cash flow pressure from increased accounts receivable  
2. Higher debt requirements to fund installment financing  
3. Customer payment default risk  
4. System integration challenges  
5. Potential brand misalignment if financing terms are not communicated clearly  

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Partner with a third-party financing provider to reduce credit risk  
2. Launch financing in phases to limit AR exposure  
3. Strengthen credit checks and fraud detection  
4. Ensure transparent communication of financing terms  
5. Implement automated AR tracking and repayment workflows
